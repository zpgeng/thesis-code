Repository of Master's Thesis "Nonparemetric variable selection under latent confounding"

# Code files for the Section 4

## File hierarchy

In brief, our workflow for the thesis is organised into 7 experiments

- a `exp1` folder containing all codes for Experiment 1,
- a `exp2` folder containing all codes for Experiment 2,
- a `exp3` folder containing all codes and output plots (as .png) for Experiment 3,
- a `exp4` folder containing all codes and output plots for Experiment 4,
- a `exp5` folder containing all codes for Experiment 5,
- a `exp6` folder containing all codes and output plots for Experiment 6,
- a `exp7` folder containing all codes and plots for Experiment 7,
    - a `results` folder containing all `.RData` outputs for Experiment 7.

## Replicating instruction for Folder `exp7`

  1. First run  `exp7_PCA.R` and generate the results into folder `results`.
  2.
